How will you test the changes?
The change will be tested in a non-production environment such as a test cluster, which is mimicing the production cluster (doesn't exist yet though). 
Canary testing cannot be applied here as at this point there is no production cluster, hence no traffic can be redirected. 
Since we are running no service mash and no production cluster, changes aren't rolled out incrementally.
Changes can be saefly rolled back by keeping the older cluster configuration version (e.g. using version contorl)

How will you ensure the changes don't negatively affect your cluster?
The change should be tested in a non-production cluster. Once the change is applied, you should monitor metrics using your observability and monitoring techniques like Prometheus and Grafana
Roll back the confugation in case of any negative affects.
