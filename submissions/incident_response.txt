Unauthorized crypto mining activities were detected within our infrastructure, indicating a security breach. 
Attackers successfully deployed several crypto mining containers using our CPU resources.

Summary of what was affected:
The breach affected our Kubernetes cluster, where attackers gained unauthorized access and deployed crypto mining containers. 
The specific containers identified were associated with mining activities, utilizing significant CPU resources and potentially compromising system performance and security.

Summary of the impact:
The impact of this incident was significant, primarily on our CPU resources, which were heavily utilized by the unauthorized mining activities. 
This not only degraded system performance but also posed a serious security risk, indicating vulnerabilities in our system that were exploited by the attackers.

Summary of the remediation steps:
Immediate action was taken to mitigate the incident, including the deletion of the unauthorized pods using the kubectl command. 
Monitoring tools were then employed to observe the reduction in CPU usage, confirming the successful removal of the mining containers. 
Additional security measures were implemented to prevent future breaches.

Summary of lessons learned:
This incident highlighted the necessity of enhancing our security posture, particularly regarding admission control and monitoring. 
Implementing stricter admission controls can prevent the deployment of unauthorized containers, while improved monitoring can facilitate the early detection of unusual activities. 
Adjusting priority levels in monitoring tools can ensure that critical alerts are promptly addressed, enhancing our overall security framework.
